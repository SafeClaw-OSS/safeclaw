# Agent-surface redesign — LOCKED decisions (2026-07-05)

Follows the shipped schema rework (commits `ab08fc3`…`5f9b7e6` on `feat/broker-phantom`
+ `2b20e66` on `feat/broker-phantom-fe`). Build this on the SAME branches, then fold
into canon (`CREDENTIAL_BROKER.md` / `CONNECTION_SCHEMA.md`) + delete this file, then
merge → e2e. Every point is settled with the user via a constraint-first derivation —
do NOT re-litigate. Method that produced these: [[feedback_design_constraints_first]].

---

## 1. Opt-in, NOT a mandatory proxy
Normal traffic goes DIRECT and untouched. Only credential traffic — a request the agent
DELIBERATELY writes a phantom into — is routed through the proxy (via `sc run --`, or a
per-request `--proxy $SAFECLAW_PROXY_URL`). We do NOT require a global `HTTPS_PROXY`.
Why (hard architectural reasons): (a) a credential broker must not sit in the critical
path of non-credential traffic — a dead daemon must degrade ONLY vault features, not all
egress; (b) child-scoping is the positioning pillar (not "全机器流量"); (c) the agent is
smart enough to opt in — writing a phantom IS the opt-in signal (dumb tools need a blanket
proxy; agents don't). Failure mode is safe: a phantom sent unrouted reaches the upstream as
a literal string → clean 401, never a leak.

## 2. Single port, dual-face (the 0x5AFE port serves both)
`PROXY_PORT` (23294) is the agent's ONLY port. One listener, dispatched by RFC 7230 §5.3
request-line form:
- **proxy face** — `CONNECT host:443` or absolute-form `GET http://host/…` → MITM /
  blind-tunnel (existing behavior). Loop guard: an absolute-form request whose authority ==
  self is treated as a direct request (answer, never forward) — standard Squid/Privoxy move.
- **API face** — origin-form `GET /v/{vid}/registry`, `GET /op/{id}`, `GET /health` →
  self-answer a READ-ONLY subset. This is what the agent hits directly for discovery/poll.
`CONTROL_PORT` (23295) keeps every WRITE/ceremony route (op create/approve/reject, passkey,
pending-passkey, events, approvals, secret-keys, usage, sync, admin, pubkey, skill.md, the
static `/registry`) — CLI + human only, invisible to the agent. Precedent: Privoxy/Squid
serve a management page + proxy on one port. hudsucker hook: origin-form currently lands in
`handle_request`'s `uri().host()==None → forward` branch (which fails) — route it to the API
responder instead. Security bonus: the agent-reachable API face is an explicit read-only
whitelist; writes stay passkey-gated on 23295.

## 3. Discovery + op-poll are a plain DIRECT GET (never through the proxy)
Discovery carries no phantom → it doesn't need the proxy. Routing it through the proxy
(an earlier idea) taxed the agent's single most reliable primitive ("GET a URL, parse
JSON") with proxy ceremony — rejected. So:
`GET $SAFECLAW_DAEMON_URL/v/$SAFECLAW_VAULT_ID/registry` and `…/op/{id}` — plain, direct,
to the 23294 API face. This is consistent with opt-in (no phantom ⇒ no proxy).

## 4. The agent's four env vars — delivered by its install prompt (§11), copied VERBATIM
```
SAFECLAW_DAEMON_URL=http://127.0.0.1:23294               # API face: GET $DAEMON_URL/v/$VAULT_ID/registry, /op/<id>
SAFECLAW_VAULT_ID=<vid>                                  # discovery path param + the proxy-auth username
SAFECLAW_API_KEY=<key>                                   # agent identity — Bearer on the API face; §8
SAFECLAW_PROXY_URL=http://<vid>:<key>@127.0.0.1:23294    # proxy face: vid=user, api-key=password (Proxy-Auth); §8
```
Four vars — the api-key is the agent's auth to BOTH faces (§8), riding the API-face
`Authorization: Bearer` AND the proxy-face `Proxy-Authorization` password. **These four are
the AGENT's config, delivered by its install prompt (§11) — NOT by `sc env`** (that is the
device/human's tool). Whoever mints the connection (console / local CLI) knows the vid + the
new key + the daemon address, so it pre-assembles all four; the agent copies each verbatim
(incl. `PROXY_URL`, so the agent never does userinfo surgery).
Two channels carry `(vid, key)` two different ways — this is the load-bearing distinction
(don't conflate a REQUEST url with a PROXY url):

| channel | what it is | vid | key | fetch-safe because |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **API face** (discovery, op-poll) | a normal request TO the daemon (`fetch($DAEMON_URL/v/$VAULT_ID/registry)`) | URL **path** | `Authorization: Bearer` **header** | the request URL (`DAEMON_URL`) is userinfo-free |
| **proxy face** (credential traffic) | a request THROUGH the daemon as a proxy | proxy-userinfo **username** | proxy-userinfo **password** | a PROXY url is not a request url — userinfo is the standard proxy-auth channel |

Hard constraints that force this shape (four single-purpose vars, zero assembly):
- **`fetch()` throws on a REQUEST url with credentials** (WHATWG) → `DAEMON_URL` must be
  userinfo-free → it can't also be the proxy URL. Key rides a `Bearer` header, vid rides the
  path.
- **an HTTPS proxied request is a `CONNECT`** → its only auth channel is `Proxy-Authorization`,
  which the client derives from the PROXY url's userinfo → `PROXY_URL` carries `<vid>:<key>@`.
  This rule does NOT hit the fetch restriction (it's a proxy url, not a request url), and the
  SHIPPED design already carries the vid here (`<vid>:@`, empty pw) across tools — the key
  just fills the empty password slot (same mechanism, no new risk).
- daemon side: API face reads `Bearer <key>` + the path vid; proxy face decodes
  `Proxy-Authorization: Basic base64("<vid>:<key>")` → vid (route) + key (verify, §8). No
  request url ever carries credentials.
Soft principle: every agent-facing value is copied verbatim, never assembled (assembly =
silent-error surface, same rule as "copy the phantom, never build it") — hence the prompt
pre-bakes `PROXY_URL` rather than making the agent splice userinfo. The port is `PROXY_PORT`
(23294): the agent's `DAEMON_URL` is the API face, not the control root. `$SAFECLAW_VAULT_URL`
(the combined URL) is RETIRED; **`$SAFECLAW_API_KEY` STAYS** (§8). The agent never sets a
global `HTTPS_PROXY` (that would route everything = the rejected blast-radius model); `sc run`
sets `HTTPS_PROXY`+CA on the CHILD from the agent's own `PROXY_URL`.

## 5. Vault selection — snapshot binding; `sc` and agent stay consistent via env-pin precedence
- **Binding = SNAPSHOT, not live.** The agent's vault is fixed by its env (from its install
  prompt, §6/§11); the human's `sc vault use` changes the DEVICE's durable default
  (`config.toml`) → affects the human's shell + future connections, NOT a running agent. Divergence is LEGITIMATE (stability >
  auto-follow), matching env-at-exec (`AWS_PROFILE`) + the canonical "agent⊥vault". **Do NOT
  live-resolve the vault from config in the proxy/discovery paths** — that would rebuild the
  rug-pull.
- **`resolve_active` precedence (REVISES [[project_vault_selection_env_model]]'s "must NOT
  read env"):** `--vault flag  >  $SAFECLAW_VAULT_ID / $SAFECLAW_DAEMON_URL (env pin)  >
  config.toml`. Mainstream (env overrides file: `AWS_PROFILE`, `kubectl`). This is the ONE
  choke point every `sc` command routes through → up/status/run/git-credential/env all honor
  the agent's pin, so the agent's shelled-out `sc` calls match its own HTTP. The old "must
  NOT read env" was combined-URL-era + protected `sc vault use`; the clean 3-var selector +
  the agent-consistency principle make env>config correct. Human ergonomics preserved: fresh
  shell (no env) → config → `sc vault use` works; pinned shell → its pin, switch via re-eval
  or `--vault` (identical to exported `AWS_PROFILE`).
- **Single-vault auto-select:** a daemon with exactly one vault → `resolve_active` defaults
  to it (no `sc vault use`, nothing in the install prompt). Divergence can't even occur in
  the common single-vault case.
- **`sc status` visibility** (build it now, testable at e2e): show config's default vault vs
  the current shell's pinned vault, and flag a mismatch ("shell pinned to A; default is B;
  `eval \"$(sc env)\"` to move this shell").

## 6. Install / bootstrap — the prompt IS the agent's config (all four vars, key included)
The install prompt is the agent's self-contained config source (§4 / §11), generated per
agent×vault connection. Whoever mints it (the console for a remote vault, local `sc` for
self-host) knows the daemon URL + the vault id + a freshly-minted per-agent key, so it emits
the four ready-to-paste vars (`SAFECLAW_DAEMON_URL` / `VAULT_ID` / `API_KEY` / `PROXY_URL`).
The agent sets them in its OWN env/config and holds them — **the agent manages its own key**
([[project_vault_agent_architecture]]). Per-agent by construction: a second agent gets its own
prompt → its own key → `sc agent rm` revokes just that one. The key IS in the prompt (the
intuitive place — it's per-agent, not device state); it's account-level, so treat a leaked
prompt like a leaked key (revoke + re-issue). This RETIRES the earlier vault-scoped pair-token
idea — the prompt carries the four vars directly, simpler. `config.toml` (the device/human's
active vault + catalog) is a SEPARATE source, unaffected; `sc env` bridges it for the human's
own shell, not the agent.

## 7. Egress floor — just mainstream SSRF hygiene, no name special-cases
`host_is_blocked_name` over-reaches (blocks all `.internal` + special-cases
`metadata.google.internal`). Mainstream forward proxies do NEITHER. Reduce to the standard:
- **block literal private/loopback/link-local/multicast/unspecified IP ranges** (`127/8`,
  `10/8`, `172.16/12`, `192.168/16`, `169.254/16` — the metadata IP falls in this range, so
  it's covered without naming it — `::1`, `fc00::/7`, …). This is `host_is_blocked_ip`; keep.
- **block the RFC-6761 loopback names** `localhost` / `*.localhost`.
- **allow every other name**, including `*.internal` and `metadata.google.internal`. A
  credential only reaches a host a HUMAN deliberately anchored (curated-service PR / `sc
  connect` behind a passkey), and we don't resolve DNS at egress — so there's no default-
  reachable SSRF to name-block against. No `safeclaw.internal` reservation (§9: no magic host).

## 8. The api-key IS the agent's auth — MOVE the check onto the live proxy (fixes a real hole)
NOT vestigial. The trust boundary is NOT "localhost" — a machine runs many agents/processes,
any of which could send a phantom. The api-key is the AGENT's identity (agent ≡ api-key,
account-level — [[project_vault_agent_architecture]]); it scopes + revokes per-agent access.
**The real bug:** the phantom-only pivot moved the broker to the proxy but LEFT the api-key
check on the dead `/export` stub — so the live proxy currently authenticates NOBODY; any
localhost process with the public vid can use an unlocked vault's allow-level creds. Fix —
**move the check onto both faces, don't delete it:**
- **proxy face:** carry the key in the Proxy-Auth PASSWORD slot —
  `Proxy-Authorization: Basic base64("<vid>:<api-key>")` (today it's `<vid>:`, empty pw). The
  proxy verifies `sha256(key) ∈ agent_key_hashes` BEFORE substituting any phantom; miss → 407.
- **API face (discovery/op):** `Authorization: Bearer <api-key>`; same check.
- Keep `$SAFECLAW_API_KEY`; `$SAFECLAW_PROXY_URL` embeds it in the password. **Revert the
  skill's "local daemon needs no api-key"** (that was my error).
- "localhost-only justifies it" still holds: the key needn't be a strong network secret
  (loopback surface); a same-user process that reads the agent's env can steal it — out of
  scope, same as any env-var secret. The key's job is per-agent identity / scoping /
  revocation, not perfect same-user isolation.

## 9. Simplifications the opt-in decision unlocks (delete, don't build)
- **Retire ALL routing-detection.** In opt-in the agent routes every vault request EXPLICITLY
  → the "phantom sent unrouted" state is unreachable → detection is dead code. Delete
  `is_routed`, the through-proxy liveness probe (`PROBE_HOST`/`probe_response`/`PROBE_URL`/the
  `probe_via` routing use), and the §8 `sc status` routing block (`https_proxy` raw value +
  `ca_trust` introspection, and the `raw_https_proxy`/`ca_trust_vars`/`proxy_reachable`
  helpers). `sc status` keeps: daemon liveness via a DIRECT `GET $DAEMON_URL/health`, the
  connections projection, and the pin-vs-config vault view (§5).
- **No magic host at all** (probe retired) → `.internal` is purely §7's over-reach fix.
- **`poll_url` absolute.** The captive-portal 401 currently returns a RELATIVE `poll_url`
  (`/op/<id>`) — emitted while proxying e.g. a gmail request, it resolves against gmail's
  domain. Make it absolute: `$SAFECLAW_DAEMON_URL/op/<id>` (the 23294 API face).

## 11. Who owns the key: the AGENT, not the device — the prompt delivers it, `sc env` never emits it
The entity model settles this. **Routing (which daemon + vault) and principal (which agent =
the key) are ORTHOGONAL, with different owners.** The key is per-agent (agent ≡ api-key,
account-level revoke/audit — [[project_vault_agent_architecture]]), so it is the AGENT's:
delivered by the AGENT's install prompt (§6), held in the agent's own env/config. It is NOT
device state.
- **`sc env` does NOT emit the key** (nor a key-bearing `PROXY_URL`). `sc env` / `config.toml`
  are the DEVICE/human's config (the human's active vault + catalog). Baking a per-agent key
  into a device-level `sc env` would collapse every agent on the device to ONE key — losing
  per-agent revocation/audit. (This corrects an earlier draft of this section that proposed
  local key-persistence + `sc env` emitting it — that conflated device and agent ownership.)
- **The install prompt pre-bakes all four vars** (§4), incl. `PROXY_URL` with the key already
  in the userinfo — the minter (console / local `sc`) knows vid+key+daemon, so the agent
  copies verbatim, zero assembly. Blind-capture is dropped: the key IS in the prompt (the
  intuitive, per-agent place). Minting registers the key's hash so the daemon accepts it
  (cloud-synced, or locally seeded — §10).
- **`sc run` / `sc status`, shelled by the agent, read the agent's OWN env** (via §5's env-pin
  precedence): `sc run` propagates the agent's `PROXY_URL`+CA to the child; it never owns or
  persists the key. The human's own control-plane `sc` (op / approve / passkey) needs no key.

Setup chain, end to end:
```
mint a connection (console for a remote vault / local `sc` for self-host)
  → prompt = the 4 pre-baked vars incl the per-agent key   [+ register the key's hash → daemon accepts it]
  → agent pastes them into its own env/config, holds them (agent manages its own key)
  → daemon: verify key ∈ agent_key_hashes (§8) + route by vid + policy   →  discover + use
config.toml (device/human) is a SEPARATE source; `sc env` bridges it for the human's shell only.
```

## 10. Open / implementation notes (resolve during build, not design forks)
- **CA trust for the self-construct case (gmail via the agent's own HTTP client).** A request
  the agent proxies to a MITM'd host gets our resident-CA leaf → the client must trust our
  CA. `sc run` sets the CA vars for a child; for the agent's OWN client, confirm the path
  (either the agent runs the request under `sc run`, or its client trusts `ca.pem`). Do NOT
  emit a global `SSL_CERT_FILE` from `sc env` that would REPLACE the system bundle for
  non-MITM'd hosts — prefer additive (`NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS`) or `sc run` scoping.
- **Local api-key source (§8).** `agent_key_hashes` empty ⇒ reject everything (paired-cloud
  model). A local/unpaired daemon must accept a locally-issued key (via `sc agent add`) so
  the e2e agent can authenticate; confirm the daemon seeds its own hash set locally, not only
  from cloud sync.
- **Stale local `config.toml`** on the dev box has `daemon = …:23294` (pre-swap) — a fresh
  enroll writes the correct control root; not a code bug.
- The registry/op projections currently live as axum handlers on 23295 — refactor the
  read-only ones into shared functions the 23294 API face can call (given state + vid).

---

## Build order (post-compact, one pass on `feat/broker-phantom` + `-fe`)
core: (a) proxy 23294 API face — dispatch origin-form → read-only `/v/{vid}/registry`,
`/op/{id}`, `/health`; loop guard; share the projections. (b) retire routing-detection
(is_routed / probe / §8 routing block + helpers) → `sc status` = direct health + connections
+ the pin-vs-config vault view. (c) `sc env` = DEVICE/human config only — emit
`SAFECLAW_DAEMON_URL` + `SAFECLAW_VAULT_ID` for the human's shell, NO key, no global
`HTTPS_PROXY`; retire `$SAFECLAW_VAULT_URL`. The AGENT's four vars (incl `PROXY_URL`=`<vid>:<key>@`)
are minted into its install prompt (§6/§11), NOT emitted by `sc env`. (d) `resolve_active` →
`--vault > env pin > config`; single-vault auto-select; `sc status` pin-vs-config mismatch.
(e) MOVE the api-key check onto the proxy (Proxy-Auth password) + the API face (Bearer); a
local/unpaired daemon must accept a locally-issued key. (f) egress floor = mainstream IP
ranges + localhost names only (drop the `.internal`/metadata name blocks). (g) `poll_url`
absolute. Then: skill (opt-in; discover = direct `GET $DAEMON_URL/v/$VAULT_ID/registry` +
Bearer; use = phantom via `sc run` / `--proxy $PROXY_URL`; drop routing-preflight; REVERT
'local needs no api-key'), console/backend (the connect-agent install prompt emits the 4
pre-baked vars incl the per-agent key + registers its hash; drop the pair-token; `sc env`
device-only), tests, `cargo build`/`test`/console `tsc`, fold into canon + delete, then merge → e2e.
